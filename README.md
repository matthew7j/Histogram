Histogram
=========

Histogram Project from Software Engineering 1
=============================================

This project was done in a 5 person team environment in my Junior year at Valdosta State University.
I served as the lead programmer.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

There are several options to choose from when first running this program.

1. You can choose an existing file with data that will be parsed and put into a histographical format.

2. You can type in numbers in the textarea to be read and parsed and put into a histographical format.

3. You can generate a histogram by pressing the random button.

   -- In all of the options above, you can specify the number of bars that will appear.
   
   -- You can also save the file of the numbers that you enter to use at a later time.
   
   -- You can also choose the color that you want to use for the bars of the histogram.
   
   -- You also have the option to save the graph in a file to view later.
